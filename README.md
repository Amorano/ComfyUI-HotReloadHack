# ComfyUI-HotReloadHack
Hot reloading for custom node developers

This is a very hacky way to get hot reloading of custom nodes, but has worked very well on all workflows tested.

## Features
* Watches files in `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`
* Automatically reloads new code for any repo changed
* Clears the Comfy execution cache so Comfy will rerun nodes in changed repo
* Automatically loads in new repos that you download without the need to restart ComfyUI

## Installation
After git cloning the repo into your `custom_nodes/` you only need to install watchdog.
```
python -m pip install watchdog
```

## How to Use

HotReloadHack automatically watches files in your `custom_nodes/` directory and when one changes reloads the node repo it belongs to.

It does not use a file dependency graph (yet), so all nodes in the changed repo will run on the next Comfy execution.

### Environment Variables

`HOTRELOAD_EXCLUDE`

comma separated list of module names exclude from forcing a reload.

Note: `ComfyUIManager` and `ComfyUI-HotReloadHack` are automatically excluded.

set HOTRELOAD_EXCLUDE=Jovimetrix,ComfyUIManager

`HOTRELOAD_OBSERVE_ONLY`

comma separated list of module names to be the exclusive list of modules to scan.

`HOTRELOAD_EXTENSIONS`

comma separated list of extensions. The default is to reload on `.py, .json or .yaml` file changes *only*. If you want to have it scan all extensions, use `*`.

`HOTRELOAD_DEBOUNCE_TIME`

float value for the number of seconds the event should be reset if multiple reloads are requested. The minimum for this value is 1 second.
